            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>
                Venus also known as the Light Moon is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman 
                goddess of love and beauty. It is the third brightest natural object in the night sky after the Sun 
                and the Moon. Its observed stellar magnitude reaches -4.6 m and is sufficient for reflected light 
                from Venus to create shadows; it is rarely visible to the naked eye during the day. Because Venus is 
                closer to the Sun than to the Earth, it is always visible at a short angular distance from it; its 
                maximum elongation is 47.8 °. The distance of Venus from Earth varies from about 40 million km to 
                about 259 million km. Located about 108 million km from the Sun , Venus completes its orbit in 224.7 
                days. The rotation around its own axis is very slow, lasting 243 days, and occurs from east to west, 
                in the opposite direction to the rotation of the other planets. Venus reaches its maximum brightness 
                a few hours before sunrise or after sunset, which is why it is popularly known as the Morning Star 
                and the Evening Star. The planet has no satellites, a characteristic it shares only with Mercury among 
                the planets of the Solar System. Venus is a telluric planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister 
                planet" due to their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and chemical composition. In other 
                respects it differs radically from Terra. It has the densest atmosphere of the four telluric planets,
                 consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide . Atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 
                 times that on Earth, or about the pressure found 900 m underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the 
                 hottest planet in the Solar System, with an average surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C ; 863 °F), 
                 even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is covered in an opaque layer of sulfuric acid cloudswhich 
                 reflect well and do not allow the observation of its surface from space in visible light . There are 
                 speculations that oceans existed on Venus in the past, [15] [16] like on Earth, but evaporated as the 
                 surface temperature increased. [17] Water was probably photodissociated , and free hydrogen was scattered 
                 into interplanetary space by the solar wind due to the lack of a planetary magnetic field.  Venus does not 
                 have a large metallic core like Earth's, which is why it does not have a protective magnetic field. The 
                 current landscape of Venus is a dry desert with dust-covered rocks.

            <h1>Internal structure</h1>
            <p>
                Without seismic moment-of-inertia data and information, little direct information is available about 
                the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. [53] The similarity in size and density between 
                Venus and Earth suggests that they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle and crust. 
                Like Earth's, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets cooled at about 
                the same rate. Venus' somewhat smaller size suggests that pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior 
                than on Earth. The main difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics 
                on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong for subduction without the presence of water. This 
                results in reduced heat loss to the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation 
                for the lack of an internally generated magnetic field . [56] Instead, Venus can lose its internal heat in 
                major periodic rewarming events.

            <h1>Geography</h1>
            <p>
                The Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until the 20th century when some of its secrets were 
                revealed by planetary science. The Venera landers that landed in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface 
                covered with relatively angular sediments and rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990-1991. 
                Venusian soil shows evidence of extensive volcanism , and sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that recent 
                eruptions have occurred. About 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth volcanic plains, of which 
                70% are low ridge plains and 10% are flat or undulating. [32] Two mountain ranges make up the rest of its 
                surface, one that is in the northern hemisphere of the planet and the other, the largest, is located south 
                of the equator. The northern highland is called Terra Ishtar , after Ishtar , the Babylonian goddess of 
                love, and is about the size of Australia. Mount Maxwell, the highest mountain on Venus, is on Ishtar Terra.
                 Its summit is 11 km above the Venusian altitude. [33] The southern highlands are called Terra Aphrodite, 
                 after the goddess of love in Greek mythologyand is the larger of the two mountainous regions, being roughly 
                 the size of South America. A network of outcrops and faults covers much of this area.The lack of evidence 
                 of lava accompanying any visible caldera flow remains an enigma. The planet has few impact craters, proving 
                 that the surface is relatively young, about 300-600 million years old. In addition to the craters, mountains, 
                 and valleys commonly found on other rocky planets, Venus has a number of unique surface features. These include: 
                 flat-topped volcanic domes called "farra", which are 20-50 km in diameter and 100-1000 m in height and look 
                 somewhat like pancakes; radial, star-shaped fracture systems called "novae"; formations composed of radial and 
                 concentric fractures, resembling spider webs, known as "arachnoids" and "crowns", circular rings of fractures, 
                 sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are of volcanic origin.
