                <h1>Let's explore our solar system</h1>
                <p>
                    The Solar System consists of the Sun and everything that orbits it, 
                    including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. 
                    The order of the planets in our solar system, starting from the Sun, 
                    is as follows: Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , 
                    and possibly the ninth planet. The Solar System stretches from the Sun, 
                    called Sol by the ancient Romans, past the four inner planets, 
                    through the asteroid belt to the four gas giants, then to the Kuiper Belt 
                    and far beyond to the heliopause. Astronomers estimate that the edge of our 
                    solar system is 15 billion kilometers from the Sun. Beyond the heliopause is the giant, 
                    spherical Oort Cloud believed to surround the Solar System.
                    Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, children have learned at school that our solar system 
                    has nine planets. But that changed in the 1990s, when astronomers began to question
                    whether Pluto was really a planet. In an extremely controversial decision, 
                    the International Astronomical Union decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a "dwarf planet", 
                    thus reducing the list of true planets in the Solar System to only eight.
                    However, astronomers are still hunting for another planet in our solar system, 
                    a true new planet, after mathematical proof of its existence was revealed on January 20, 2016. 
                    It is believed that the supposed "New Planet", also called "Planet X" , 
                    would be about ten times the mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto .

                <h1>Types of planets in the Solar System</h1>
                <p>
                    The four inner planets, closest to the Sun , Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars , are often called
                    "terrestrial planets" because their surfaces are solid, rocky. Pluto also has a rocky
                     but icy surface and was never included in the group of four terrestrial planets.
                    The four large outer planets— Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune —are sometimes called 
                    the Jovian or "Jupiter-like" planets, due to their enormous size compared to the terrestrial
                     planets. They are made of gases like hydrogen, helium and ammonia, not rocky surfaces, 
                     although astronomers think some or even all of them may have solid cores.
                    Jupiter and Saturn are also called gas giants, while the more distant Uranus and Neptune
                    are also called ice giants. The reason is that Uranus and Neptune have more water and other
                    ice-forming molecules in their atmospheres, such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and phosphine, 
                    which crystallize as clouds in the icy conditions of these planets. For example, 
                    methane crystallizes at -183 degrees Celsius, according to the US National Library of Medicine.

                <h1>What is (and isn't) a planet?</h1>
                <p>
                    The International Astronomical Union defines a planet as a body that orbits the Sun without 
                    being the satellite of another object, is large enough for gravity to give it a round shape 
                    (but not so large as to make nuclear fusion possible, as in the case of a star) and which has 
                    removed most of the other bodies from its orbit.
                    But this restrictive definition helped isolate what should or should not be considered a planet
                    — a problem that arose as astronomers discovered more and more planet-like objects in the
                     Solar System. One such example is Pluto , which has been reclassified as a "dwarf planet".
                    The problem with Pluto , apart from its small size and unusual orbit, is that it hasn't 
                    cleared all its debris from its neighborhood -it shares its space with a lot of Kuiper Belt
                    objects. However, Pluto 's retrograde remains controversial.
                    The planet definition places small, round worlds in the category of dwarf planets, 
                    including the Kuiper Belt objects Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.
                    Ceres, a round object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , was also reclassified. 
                    Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, but was later relegated to the
                    asteroid category, even though it is much larger and rounder than the other asteroids. 
                    Instead, in 2006, astronomers classified it as a dwarf planet, although some like to think
                    of it as the tenth planet (not to be confused with Planet X).
