            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>
            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, orbiting it once every 88 Earth days. Its brightness 
            varies between -2.0 and 5.5 in apparent magnitude, but it is not easy to see because its greatest 
            angular separation (greatest elongation) from the Sun is only 28.3Â°, meaning that it can be seen 
            just after sunset. In the period 1974 - 1975, Mercury was studied with the aid of the Mariner 10 probe, 
            which mapped only 40 - 45% of the planet's surface. Since 2011, the MESSENGER spacecraft has been 
            orbiting the planet to study its chemical composition, geology and magnetic field.
            Based on data provided by MESSENGER, Paul K. Byrne and Christian Klimczak (Carnegie Institution for 
            Science - Washington) produced a detailed map showing that Mercury contracted substantially as it 
            cooled. According to the researchers, Mercury has decreased its radius by up to 7 km, compared to 
            the maximum 1-2 km as thought until now, the planet currently has a radius of 2440 km.
            Physically, the planet Mercury is similar in appearance to the Moon, being studded with craters. 
            It has no natural satellites and no denser atmosphere. The planet has a large iron core that generates 
            a magnetic field about 100 times weaker than Earth's. The surface temperature of Mercury varies from 
            about 90 K to 700 K, with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottom of the craters near the 
            poles being the coldest points.Recorded sightings of the planet Mercury date back to the time of the 
            Sumerians, in the third millennium BC. The Romans named the planet after the messenger god Mercury 
            (in Greece Hermes, in Babylonia Nabu ), probably because of its apparently rapid movement in the 
            twilight sky. The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version of the god's head wearing a 
            winged hat, on a caduceus, an ancient astrological symbol. Before the 5th century BC Greek 
            astronomers believed that the planet consisted of two separate objects: one visible only at sunrise 
            and the other visible only at sunset. In India the planet was called Budha, after the son of Chandra 
            (of the Moon). Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet Mercury as the
             "Water Star", a name based on the Five Elements. Mercury left its name in the name of the day of the 
             week that follows Tuesday, namely Wednesday, from the Latin phrase: Mercurii dies / Mercuris dies.

            <h1>Internal structure: core, matle and crust</h1>
            <p>
                Mercury is one of the four telluric planets, meaning it is a rocky body, like Earth. It is the 
                smallest of the four, with a diameter of 4,879 km at the equator. In composition it has approximately 
                70% metals and 30% silicates. In terms of density, Mercury is in second place in the Solar System, 
                with 5,430 kg/m 3, a density slightly lower than that of the Earth. The high density of the planet 
                Mercury can be used to uncover details about its internal structure. While Earth's high density 
                results in part from the compression of the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions 
                are not as compressed. So, to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron. 
                Geologists estimate that the core of the planet Mercury occupies about 42% of its volume 
                (Earth's core occupies about 17% of its volume). Above the core is the mantle, which is 600 km 
                thick. It is believed that in the past of the planet Mercury, a catastrophic impact occurred, 
                being struck by a body several hundred kilometers in diameter that catapulted much of the original 
                mantle, resulting in a relatively thin mantle compared to its large core, but there are also 
                alternative theories which are discussed below.  The planet Mercury is believed to have a crust 
                around 100-200 km thick. A distinctive feature of the planet Mercury is that it has many rifts, 
                some extending for hundreds of kilometers. They are thought to have formed as the planet's core 
                and mantle cooled and contracted after the crust solidified. The planet Mercury has a higher iron 
                content than any other major planet in our solar system. Several theories have been proposed to 
                explain the high metallicity of the planet. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally 
                had a proportion of metallosilicates similar to chondrite meteorites and a mass of about 2.25 times its 
                current mass, but early in the history of the solar system, the planet Mercury it was hit by an asteroid 
                having about 1/6 of its mass. The impact would have removed much of the crust and mantle, leaving the 
                core behind. A similar theory has been proposed to explain the formation of the Moon. Another theory 
                says that Mercury formed from the solar nebula before the energy released by the Sun stabilized. 
                The planet would have originally had twice the present mass. But the protostar contracted, 
                temperatures around Mercury could reach 2,500-3,500 K, possibly even 10,000 K. Much of the surface 
                rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures, forming an atmosphere of "rock vapor" that could 
                have been carried away by the solar wind. A third theory suggests that the solar nebula caused a 
                frictional force with the accreting particles of Mercury, meaning that lighter particles were lost
                 from the accretion material. Each of these theories predicts a different composition of the planet's 
                 surface and two future space missions, Messenger and BepiColombo will make observations and test the 
                 theories.

            <h1>Exploring the planet Mercury</h1>
            <p>
                The first space probe to visit the planet Mercury is Mariner 10 produced by NASA (1974-1975). 
                The probe used Venus' gravity to adjust its orbital speed (to slow down in this case) for a 
                successful maneuver around Mercury. Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to use this "gravitational 
                slingshot" effect (using the gravity of different planets to speed up or slow down a spacecraft) 
                and also the first probe to visit multiple planets. Mariner gave us the first close-up images of 
                Mercury's surface, covered in abundance by impact craters but also other geological features such 
                as steep slopes that have been explained by the shrinking effect of the planet as a result of the 
                cooling of the iron core. Unfortunately, due to its orbital duration, Mariner 10 could only 
                observe one side of the planet that was illuminated as it passed. Because of this exploration of 
                both sides was impossible and as a result Mariner mapped less than 45% of the Mercurian surface. 
                The Mariner probe performed 3 approach maneuvers, the closest being 327 km from the planet's 
                surface. During the first maneuver the instruments detected a magnetic field to the great surprise 
                of the planetary geologists because Mercury's rotation is too slow to generate a significant 
                dynamo effect. The second approach was mainly used for imaging, but the third approach yielded a 
                lot of data on magnetism. The data indicate an Earth-like magnetic field that deflects the solar 
                wind around the planet. The origin of Mercury's magnetic field still remains the subject of several 
                competing theories. On March 24, 1975, just 8 days after its last approach maneuver, Mariner ran out 
                of fuel. Because the orbital motion could no longer be precisely controlled, the mission controllers 
                decided to stop it. Mariner 10 is believed to still be orbiting the Sun and passing close by Mercury 
                once every few months.This probe is produced by NASA and is currently in orbit around the planet Mercury. 
                The probe weighs 485 kilograms and was launched aboard a Delta 2 rocket in August 2004 to study the 
                chemical composition, geology and magnetic field of the planet Mercury. It is the second mission to Mercury, 
                the first being Mariner 10 in 1975. The probe was launched on August 3, 2004 by NASA from Cape Canaveral Air 
                Force Station Florida.
