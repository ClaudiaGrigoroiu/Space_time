            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, 
                who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus ( Jupiter ) and the father of Cronus (Saturn). 
                It is the third largest and fourth most massive planet in the Solar System. Uranus has a similar composition 
                to Neptune, and both have different chemical compositions than the largest gas giants: Jupiter and Saturn. 
                For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the 
                other gas giants. Uranus' atmosphere, while similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn in its primary composition 
                of hydrogen and helium, contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, as well as traces of other 
                hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K 
                (-224 °C). Uranus has a complex layered cloud structure, and water is thought to form the lowest clouds and 
                methane the upper cloud layer. The interior of Uranus is composed mainly of ice and rock. Like the other giant 
                planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous satellites. The Uranian system has a unique 
                configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, almost in the plane of its solar orbit. 
                Therefore, its north and south poles are where most other planets have their equator. In 1986, images 
                from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands 
                or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraftwho visited the 
                planet. Observations from Earth showed seasonal changes and an increase in weather activity as Uranus 
                approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 m/s (900 km/h).

            <h1>Orbit and rotation</h1>
            <p>
                Uranus completes an orbit around the Sun every about 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is 
                about 3 billion kilometers (20 AU ). The difference between the minimum and maximum distance from the Sun 
                is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of the dwarf planet Pluto. The 
                intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of the distance, so on Uranus (at about 20 times the 
                Earth-Sun distance) the intensity of light is about 1/400 of the intensity of light on Earth.Its orbital 
                elements were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace. Over time, discrepancies began to appear 
                between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences 
                might be due to the gravitational pull of another unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own 
                independent research into the orbit of Uranus. On September 23, 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new 
                planet, later named Neptune, almost in the position predicted by Le Verrier. The rotation period of Uranus 
                on its own axis is 17 hours and 14 minutes. Like all gas giants, its upper atmosphere has strong winds in 
                the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 °S, the prominent elements of the atmosphere 
                move much faster, making a complete rotation in only 14 hours.

            <h1>Internal structure</h1>
            <p>
                The mass of Uranus is about 14.5 times that of Earth, but it is the least massive of the giant planets.
                Its diameter is slightly larger than that of Neptune and about four times that of Earth, resulting in a 
                density of 1.27 g/cm 3, making Uranus the second densest planet (after Saturn) in the Solar System. This 
                value indicates that it is mainly composed of solidified volatiles such as water, ammonia and methane. The 
                total mass of ice inside Uranus is not precisely known because different values appear depending on the model 
                chosen; it must be between 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses. Hydrogen and helium make up only a small fraction of the 
                total, at 0.5-1.5 Earth masses. The rest of the ice-free mass (0.5 to 3.7 Earth masses) is rocky material. The 
                standard model of Uranus' structure is that the planet consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron-nickel) 
                core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and a gaseous hydrogen/helium outer shell. The core is relatively 
                small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses and a radius of less than 20% that of Uranus; the mantle comprises 
                most of the planet, at about 13.4 Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing 
                about 0.5 Earth masses and extending into the last 20% of Uranus' radius. The density of Uranus' core is about 9 
                g/cm 3, with a pressure at the center of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000 K(4,727 °C).
                The ice sheet is not actually composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot, dense fluid consisting of water, 
                ammonia, and other volatiles.This fluid, which has high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called the ammonia-water 
                ocean. Extreme pressure and temperature can destroy methane molecules, carbon atoms condensing into diamond crystals 
                that rain down through the mantle like hail. Very high-pressure experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
                suggest that the base of the mantle may contain an ocean of liquid diamond, with floating "diamond-ice" solids. Scientists 
                also believe that precipitation of solid diamonds occurs on Uranus, as well as Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The primary 
                composition of Uranus and Neptune is quite different from that of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating gas, thus 
                justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There can be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules 
                break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper into superionic water where the oxygen crystallizes, 
                but the hydrogen ions move freely in the oxygen lattice. Although the model considered above is reasonably standard, 
                it is not unique; and other models satisfy the observations. For example, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky 
                material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ice inside would be less, and thus the total mass of rocks and 
                hydrogen would be greater. Currently available data do not allow a scientific determination of the correct model.
                 The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually passes
                 into the internal liquid layers. Conventionally we call the "surface" an oval spheroid with an atmospheric pressure 
                 of 1 bar (100 kPa). It has equatorial and polar radii of 25.559 ± 4 km and 24.973 ± 20 km, respectively. This surface 
                 is used throughout this article as the zero point for elevations.
