                    <h1>Natural satellite</h1>
                    <p>
                        A natural satellite or moon is an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet.
                        In the Solar System there are 178 known natural satellites which orbit within 6 planetary satellite
                        systems. In addition, several other objects are known to have satellites, including three IAU-listed 
                        dwarf planets: Pluto, Haumea, and Eris. As of January 2012, over 200 minor-planet moons have been 
                        discovered. There are 76 known objects in the asteroid belt with satellites (five with two each), 
                        four Jupiter trojans, 39 near-Earth objects (two with two satellites each), and 14 Mars-crossers. 
                        There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects. Some 150 additional small 
                        bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn, but only a few were tracked long enough to 
                        establish orbits. Planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well, and although numerous 
                        candidates have been detected to date, none have yet been confirmed.
                        Of the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites; Earth has one large natural satellite, 
                        known as the Moon; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. The giant planets have 
                        extensive systems of natural satellites, including half a dozen comparable in size to Earth's Moon: the four 
                        Galilean moons, Saturn's Titan, and Neptune's Triton. Saturn has an additional six mid-sized natural satellites 
                        massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, and Uranus has five. It has been suggested that some 
                        satellites may potentially harbour life. The Earth-Moon system is unique in that the ratio of the mass of the 
                        Moon to the mass of Earth is much greater than that of any other natural-satellite-planet ratio in the Solar 
                        System (although there are minor-planet systems with even greater ratios, notably the Pluto-Charon system). 
                        At 3,474 km (2,158 miles) across, Earth's Moon is 0.27 times the diameter of Earth.

                    <h1>Natural satellites of the Solar System</h1>
                    <p>
                        The seven largest natural satellites in the Solar System (those bigger than 2,500 km across) are Jupiter's Galilean 
                        moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa), Saturn's moon Titan, Earth's moon, and Neptune's captured natural satellite 
                        Triton. Triton, the smallest of these, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together. Similarly in the 
                        next size group of nine natural satellites, between 1,000 km and 1,600 km across, Titania, Oberon, Rhea, Iapetus, 
                        Charon, Ariel, Umbriel, Dione, and Tethys, the smallest, Tethys, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites 
                        together. As well as the natural satellites of the various planets, there are also over 80 known natural satellites 
                        of the dwarf planets, minor planets and other small Solar System bodies. Some studies estimate that up to 15% of all 
                        trans-Neptunian objects could have satellites. The following is a comparative table classifying the natural satellites 
                        in the Solar System by diameter. The column on the right includes some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and 
                        trans-Neptunian objects for comparison. The natural satellites of the planets are named after mythological figures. 
                        These are predominantly Greek, except for the Uranian natural satellites, which are named after Shakespearean characters.

                    <h1>Terminology</h1>
                    <p>
                        The first known natural satellite was the Moon, but it was considered a "planet" until Copernicus' introduction of heliocentrism 
                        in 1543. Until the discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610, however, there was no opportunity for referring to 
                        such objects as a class. Galileo chose to refer to his discoveries as Planet√¶ ("planets"), but later discoverers chose 
                        other terms to distinguish them from the objects they orbited. The first to use of the term satellite to describe orbiting 
                        bodies was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in his pamphlet Narratio de Observatis a se quatuor Iouis satellitibus erronibus 
                        ("Narration About Four Satellites of Jupiter Observed") in 1610. He derived the term from the Latin word satelles, meaning 
                        "guard", "attendant", or "companion", because the satellites accompanied their primary planet in their journey through the 
                        heavens. The term satellite thus became the normal one for referring to an object orbiting a planet, as it avoided the ambiguity 
                        of "moon". In 1957, however, the launching of the artificial object Sputnik created a need for new terminology. The terms man-made 
                        satellite or artificial moon were very quickly abandoned in favor of the simpler satellite, and as a consequence, the term has 
                        become linked primarily with artificial objects flown in space - including, sometimes, even those not in orbit around a planet.
                        Because of this shift in meaning, the term moon, which had continued to be used in a generic sense in works of popular science and 
                        in fiction, has regained respectability and is now used interchangeably with natural satellite, even in scientific articles. When it 
                        is necessary to avoid both the ambiguity of confusion with Earth's natural satellite the Moon and the natural satellites of the other 
                        planets on the one hand, and artificial satellites on the other, the term natural satellite (using "natural" in a sense opposed to 
                        "artificial") is used. To further avoid ambiguity, the convention is to capitalize the word Moon when referring to Earth's natural 
                        satellite, but not when referring to other natural satellites.
                        Many authors define "satellite" or "natural satellite" as orbiting some planet or minor planet, synonymous with "moon" -- by such a 
                        definition all natural satellites are moons, but Earth and other planets are not satellites. A few recent authors define 
                        "moon" as "a satellite of a planet or minor planet", and "planet" as "a satellite of a star" -- such authors 
                        consider Earth as a "natural satellite of the sun".
