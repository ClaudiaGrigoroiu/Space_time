            <h1>Sun</h1>
            <p>
                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot 
                plasma, held together by gravity and shaped by a magnetic field. It is by far the most important 
                source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers 
                (or 109 times that of Earth), and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. 
                It represents approximately 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three-quarters 
                of the Sun's mass consists ofhydrogen (≈73%); the rest is mostly helium (≈25%), with much smaller
                amounts of heavier elements including oxygen , carbon , neon and iron.
                The Sun is a G-type main sequence (G2V) star. As such, it is informally and not quite exactly 
                referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed about 4.6 
                billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter in a region of a large molecular 
                cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, while the rest flattened into an orbiting 
                disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that eventually 
                nuclear fusion was initiated in its core. Almost all stars are believed to form through this 
                process. Currently, the Sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, 
                turning 4 million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 
                170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.
                When the fusion of hydrogen in the core slows to the point where the Sun is no longer in 
                hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a significant increase in density and temperature 
                while its outer layers expand, eventually turning the Sun into a red giant. It has been 
                calculated that the Sun will become large enough to incorporate the current orbits of Mercury 
                and Venus and make the Earth uninhabitable but after about five billion years. After this, 
                it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarfand 
                it will no longer produce energy through fusion, but will continue to glow and release heat from 
                its previous fusion.The Sun's enormous effect on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times,
                 and the Sun has been considered a deity in some cultures.

            <h1>General characteristics</h1>
            <p>
                The Sun is a G-type main sequence star comprising about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. 
                It has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, and is estimated to be a star brighter than about 85% of 
                the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs. The Sun is a population I star or a 
                star rich in heavy elements.The formation of the Sun could have been triggered by shock waves 
                from one or more nearby supernovae. This is suggested by the high abundance of heavy elements 
                in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundance of these elements in 
                heavy-poor Population II stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly be produced by 
                endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova or by transmutation by neutron absorption within
                a massive second-generation star. The Sun is by far the brightest object in Earth's sky, with an 
                apparent magnitude of -26.74. This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest 
                star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of -1.46. An astronomical unit (about 150,000,000 km)
                is defined as the average distance from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth, 
                although the distance varies as the Earth moves from perihelion in January to aphelion in July.
                At this average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to the Earth's horizon in about 8 
                minutes and 19 seconds, while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two 
                seconds less. The energy from this sunlight supports almost all life on Earth through photosynthesis,
                 and controls Earth's climate and weather. Sun does not have a definite boundary, as do the 
                 telluric planets, but in its outer layers, the density of gas decreases exponentially as the 
                 distance from its center increases. To be measurable, the Sun's radius is taken to be the 
                 distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.
                By this measure, the Sun is a nearly perfect sphere, with an estimated oblateness of about 9/1000000,
                 meaning that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometers. 
                 The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun. 
                 Because the Sun is made of plasma that is not a solid, its various parts can rotate at different 
                 speeds; this behavior is known as differential rotation. In a reference frame defined by the stars, 
                 the rotation period is about 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. However, due to the 
                 constant change in the observation point of the Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotation of 
                 the Sun at its equator is 28 days. The interior of the Sun is not directly observable, and the 
                 Sun itself is opaque to electromagnetic radiation. However - just as seismology uses waves 
                 generated by earthquakes to study the internal structure of the Earth - helioseismology uses 
                 pressure waves (infrasound) that pass through the interior of the Sun to study and visualize the 
                 internal structure of the star.

            <h1>Structure</h1>
            <p>
                Core. The Sun's core is believed to extend from the center to about 20-25% of the solar radius. 
                It has a density of up to 150 g/cm 3 (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of 
                about 15 million degrees Kelvin. In contrast, the surface temperature of the Sun is about 5,800 K. 
                Recent analysis of data from the SOHO mission favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the 
                radiation zone above. Throughout the life of the Sun, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in 
                the core region through a series of nuclear reactions called the pp (proton-proton) chain; 
                this process converts hydrogenin helium. Only 0.8% of the energy generated by the Sun comes 
                from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle, although this proportion is expected 
                to increase as the Sun ages.
                Radioactive zone.In the layers located more than 25% of the solar radius from the center of the Sun, 
                there is practically no nuclear transformation of the elements and no heat generation, but only 
                conduction of heat from the core, which is why the term shell is used in relation to these layers. 
                The solar matter is hot and dense enough to allow heat transfer from the center to the outside by 
                thermal radiation 
                Tachocline. The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer called the 
                tachocline. This is a region where the motion of the Sun's general rotation (differential rotation due 
                to its gaseous nature) and convection produce a velocity field that forces the plasma to flow between 
                the lines of force of the local magnetic field. This transition between the two distinct rotation 
                regimes is quite abrupt and occurs at the base of the convective zone. Estimates of the thickness of 
                this layer vary between 0.016-0.038 solar radii.
                It is currently hypothesized that a magnetic dynamo in this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.
