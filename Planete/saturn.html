            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>
                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System, after 
                Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although its density 
                is only one-eighth that of the average Earth, due to its large volume, Saturn's mass is 95 times that 
                of Earth. The name derives from the eponymous god of Roman mythology, the Titan counterpart Cronus, 
                from Greek mythology ;his astronomical symbol (♄) is a stylized representation of the sickle of the god 
                of agriculture. Saturn's interior is most likely composed of an iron-nickel core and rock (silicon and 
                oxygen compounds). The core is surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of 
                liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due 
                to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electric current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought 
                to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's but has a magnetic moment 
                580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about one-twentieth 
                that of Jupiter. The atmosphere outside is generally calm although prolonged thunderstorm patterns may persist. 
                On Saturn, winds of about 1,800 km/h blow, stronger than on Jupiter but not as high as those on Neptune. The 
                planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles 
                with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. The discovery of 83 satellites orbiting the planet has 
                been confirmed, of which 53 have official names. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest 
                in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only satellite 
                in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere. Seen from Earth, Saturn appears to be a bright star 
                in the sky, easily visible to the naked eye. It was only after the invention of the telescope, however, 
                that its rings and satellites were discovered. Although the quality of observational instruments has evolved, 
                the sending of space probes has revealed unprecedented detail. Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 passed 
                close to Saturn, but the complexity of their findings motivated the sending of an orbiter, Cassini, which 
                sent the Huygens probe to Titan's surface.

            <h1>Internal structure</h1>
            <p>
                Standard planetary models suggest that Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's, with a small rocky core 
                surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with traces of various volatiles. The temperature, pressure, and density 
                inside the planet steadily increase as it moves toward the core, causing hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper 
                layers. The core has a similar composition to Earth's, but is denser. In 2004, scientists estimated that the 
                core must be 9-22 times the mass of Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000 km. In the core, 
                temperatures of nearly 12,000 °C and a pressure of 10 million atmospheres are reached. The core is surrounded 
                by a thick layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, followed by a liquid layer of molecular hydrogen and helium that 
                turns to gas as altitude increases. The outermost layer stretches for 1,000 km and consists of a gaseous 
                atmosphere. Saturn , like Jupiter, radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. 
                Only part of this energy can be attributed to the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism ; an additional mechanism that 
                would explain the heat generated is that of a "rain" of helium droplets deep inside Saturn. As the droplets 
                descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat through friction and leaves Saturn's 
                outer layers helium-poor.

            <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
            <p>
                Saturn's outer atmosphere contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium. The proportion of helium 
                is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun. The amount of elements 
                heavier than helium ( metallicity ) is not precisely known, but the proportions are assumed to correspond 
                to the primordial abundances since the formation of the Solar System . The total mass of these heavier 
                elements is estimated to be 19-31 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in the 
                planetary core region. Traces of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been 
                detected in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, which give it its 
                typical yellowish appearance, while the lower level clouds appear to be composed of ammonium hydrosulfide 
                (NH 4 SH ) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes the photolysis of methane in the upper 
                atmosphere, leading to a series of chemical reactions of the hydrocarbons, the resulting products being 
                carried down by atmospheric eddies. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.
