            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>
                Earth (also called Terra or "Blue Planet") is the third planet from the Sun and the largest of the 
                telluric planets of the Solar System , both by mass and diameter. It is the only celestial body known 
                to harbor life. About 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The 
                remaining 70.8% is covered by water, mostly oceans, seas, bays and other bodies of salt water, but 
                also lakes, rivers and other fresh waters, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's 
                polar regions are covered in ice. The outer layer of the Earth is divided into several rigid tectonic 
                plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active 
                with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a 
                convective mantle that drives plate tectonics. Earth's atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. 
                Tropical regions receive more solar energy than polar regions and it is redistributed by atmospheric and 
                oceanic circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating surface temperatures. 
                A region's climate is determined not only by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to the ocean, 
                among other factors. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the 
                Moon, Earth's only natural satellite . The Earth orbits the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of 
                rotation is tilted relative to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction 
                between the Earth and the Moon causes the tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation around its axis, and 
                gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four 
                telluric planets. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, the Earth formed more than 4.5 
                billion years ago from the gases of the early solar system. During the first billion years of Earth's 
                history the ocean formed and then life developed in it. Life spread globally and modified Earth's 
                atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and later aerobic organisms. Some 
                geological evidence indicates that life may have appeared as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, 
                the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed 
                life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of 
                expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that have ever lived on 
                Earth are extinct. 8 billion people live on Earth today and depend on the biosphere and its natural 
                resources for survival. Humans are increasingly impacting the Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric 
                processes, and other life.

            <h1>Name and etymology</h1>
            <p>
                Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose name does not derive from Greek or Roman mythology. 
                All the other planets were named after gods and goddesses from Greco-Roman mythology. In Romanian, the 
                word "earth" is inherited from the Latin pavimentum, which means "beaten and leveled earth", 
                "slab or mosaic floor", "pavement" [38] , "floor", "paved road", " smooth place", "weft". Terra comes 
                from the Latin tĕrra (earth, soil), which in turn derives from the term of Indo-European origin terse, 
                meaning "dry part", as opposed to "watery part". But Terra was also referred to in the past as orbe 
                terracqueo . The Latin word orbe first had the meaning of "circle" and then of "world". Words referring 
                to Earth can be formed in several ways. The first is the use of the root terra, as in the word
                "terrestrial". There is also the root tellur, as can be seen in the words telluric, tellurian. 
                Both terms come from the Roman goddess Terra Mater , who apparently got her name, in turn, from the 
                ancient name of Tellus Mater . Scientific terms such as geography, geocentric, geothermal use the 
                Greek prefix geo, derived from the name of the goddess Gaia, the equivalent of Terra Mater in Greek
                mythology.

            <h1>Future</h1>
            <p>
                Earth's long - term future is tied to that of the Sun. In the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity 
                will increase by 10%, and in the next 3.5 billion by 40%. Earth's rising surface temperature will 
                accelerate the carbon cycle, reducing the concentration of CO 2 to lethally low levels for plants, 
                in about 500-900 million years. The lack of vegetation will lead to a decrease in oxygen in the 
                atmosphere, making animal life impossible. After another billion years, all surface water will 
                disappear  and the average global temperature will reach 70 °C (158 °F). From that time, Earth is 
                expected to be habitable for another 500 million years, possibly longer if nitrogen is removed from 
                the atmosphere. Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the ocean water would descend into 
                the Earth's mantle within a billion years. The Sun will evolve into a red giant in about 5 billion 
                years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to about 1 AU (150 million km), about 250 times its 
                current radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose about 30% of its mass, 
                so that, without taking tidal effects into account, the Earth will orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km) from 
                the Sun when the star reaches at its maximum range. The remaining life will be destroyed by the 
                increased brightness of the Sun (which will reach a maximum value of 5000 times its current level). 
                A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually shrink due to tidal effects, causing 
                Earth to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.
