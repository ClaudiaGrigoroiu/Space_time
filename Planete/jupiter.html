            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
                The Solar System consists of the Sun and everything that orbits it, 
                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
                It is a gas giant with a mass of one thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times the 
                total mass of all the other planets in the Solar System.
                Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky and has been 
                known to ancient civilizations since the time of recorded history. It is named after the Roman 
                god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast 
                shadows, and is on average the third brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon 
                and Venus .
                Jupiter is made up of three-quarters hydrogen and one-quarter helium. 
                It may have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a 
                well-defined solid surface. Due to its rapid rotation, the shape of the planet is that of a 
                rotational ellipsoid (flatter at the poles and more convex at the equator). The outer atmosphere 
                is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms 
                along their interaction boundaries. The most famous detail of its surface is the Great Red Spot 
                discovered in the 17th century with a telescope, which is an anticyclone with a diameter larger 
                than the diameter of the Earth. The planet has barely visible rings and a strong magnetosphere. 
                Jupiter has 67 known satellites including the four Galilean satellites discovered by Galileo Galilei 
                in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, is larger in diameter than the planet Mercury.
                Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet on 
                December 4, 1973; about a year later Pioneer 11 followed. Voyager 1 visited the planet in the 
                spring of 1979, followed by Voyager 2 in July of the same year. The Galileo spacecraftreached 
                Jupiter in 1995. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used 
                Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and headed for Pluto. The most recent probe to visit 
                Jupiter is Juno, which entered orbit around the planet on July 4, 2016. Future targets for 
                exploration of the Jupiter system include its satellite Europa, for its ice-covered liquid ocean.

            <h1>Internal structure</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense core containing various elements, surrounded by a layer 
                of helium-infused liquid metallic hydrogen that extends outward to about 78% of the planet's radius,
                and an outer layer that consists mainly of molecular hydrogen. Other than this general outline, 
                the interior structure is unknown. The Juno mission, which arrived in July 2016, found that Jupiter 
                has a very diffuse core mixed into the mantle. One possible cause is an impact with a planet of 
                about ten Earth masses a few million years after the formation of Jupiter, which would have 
                disrupted an initially solid Jovian core.
                Above the metallic hydrogen layer is a transparent inner hydrogen atmosphere. At this depth, 
                the pressure is above the critical hydrogen pressure of 1.2858 MPa and the temperature above 
                the critical temperature of only 32.938 K. In this state, there is no clear boundary between 
                different phases of hydrogen (liquid, gas) hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state. 
                It is convenient to treat hydrogen as the gas extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth 
                of about 1,000 km, and as a liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary - 
                the gas gets hotter and denser as it descends. Raindrops of helium and neon precipitate down 
                through the lower atmosphere, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. 
                According to the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism, the temperature and pressure in Jupiter are constantly
                 increasing. At the pressure level of 10 bar (1 MPa ), the temperature is around 340 K (67 °C). 
                 In the transition phase region where hydrogen—heated beyond its critical point—becomes metallic, 
                 the temperature is calculated to be 10,000 K (9,700 °C) and the pressure is 200 GPa. 
                 The temperature at the boundary of the core is estimated to be 36,000 K (35,700 °C), 
                 and the internal pressure is about 3,000-4,500 GPa.

            <h1>Atmosphere and Cloud layers</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, extending to an altitude of 
                5,000 km. Because Jupiter has no surface, the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to
                be the point where the atmospheric pressure is equal to 100 kPa.
                Cloud Layers. Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly 
                ammonium hydrosulfide. Clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged in bands of different 
                latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into areas with lighter shades and 
                darker belts. The interactions of these structures cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds in 
                these regions often reach 100 m/s (360 km/h).The zones have been observed to vary in width, color 
                and intensity from year to year, but have remained stable enough for scientists to give them 
                identifying names.
                The cloud layer is about 50 km deep and consists of at least two cloud decks: a thick lower deck 
                and a clearer region. There may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer. 
                This layer is highlighted by flashes of lightning detected in Jupiter's atmosphere. Electrical 
                discharges can be up to a thousand times stronger than lightning on Earth. Water clouds are thought
                 to generate storms much like terrestrial storms, driven by heat input from the planet's interior. 
                 The orange and brown color of Jupiter's clouds is caused by compounds that change color when
                  exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. Their exact composition remains unknown, 
                  but the substances are believed to be: phosphorus, sulfur and possibly hydrocarbons. 
                  These colored compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower cloud deck. 
                  Bright areas occur when upward motion within convective cells causes ammonia to crystallize, 
                  crystals of which cover the lower clouds.
                  Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles consistently receive less solar radiation than the
                 planet's equatorial region. At the same time, convection within the planet transports more energy 
                 to the poles, balancing cloud layer temperatures.
