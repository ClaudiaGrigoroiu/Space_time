            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p>
                Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun in the solar system. Named after the Roman god of the 
                sea, Neptune, it is the fourth planet in diameter and third in mass. Neptune has a mass 17 times 
                that of Earth and slightly more than the mass of Uranus, which is 15 times heavier than Earth but 
                not as dense. Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of 30.1 AU, meaning its orbit is about 30 times 
                larger than Earth's orbit. Neptune's astronomical symbol is ♆, a modified version of the god Neptune's 
                trident. Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical calculations. The planet Neptune was discovered 
                due to gravitational perturbations in the orbit of Uranus that led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesize the 
                existence of an eighth planet. Neptune was later observed on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle, at a 
                distance of less than one degree from the position predicted by the calculations of Urbain Le Verrier. 
                Shortly after this, its satellite Triton was also discovered. Another 12 satellites were discovered in 
                the 20th century. On August 25, 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft passed by the planet. Neptune has a composition 
                similar to that of Uranus, with the compositions of both planets being different from those of the larger 
                gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune's atmosphere is similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn in that it is 
                composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, traces of hydrocarbons, and possibly nitrogen, but has higher 
                proportions of water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomers sometimes classify Neptune and Uranus as "ice 
                giants" to emphasize these distinctions. Neptune's interior, like that of Uranus, is composed primarily 
                of rock and ice. Traces of methane in the upper atmosphere mostly give the planet a bluish appearance. Unlike 
                the uniform atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune has an atmosphere with visible details denoting meteorological 
                activity. For example, in 1989, when Voyager 2 approached Neptune, a large dark spot, similar to the Great Red 
                Spot on Jupiter, was observed. These meteorological phenomena are produced by the strongest winds in the solar 
                system, whose speeds reach, according to measurements, 2100 km/h. Also, because Neptune is far from the Sun, 
                it has one of the coldest atmospheres in the Solar System , with cloud-top temperatures reaching -218 °C (55 K). 
                The temperature of its center is about 5000 °C. Neptune has a two-ring system that is hard to see and is 
                fragmented; the existence of the rings was suggested by analyzes of some 1968 photographs of the planet, but 
                definite confirmation was made only in 1989 by the Voyager 2 probe.

            <h1>Planetary rings</h1>
            <p>
                Neptune has a planetary ring system, although they are much smaller than Saturn's rings. The rings contain 
                ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based substances, which give them a reddish color. The three 
                main rings are the Adams Ring, 63,000 km from Neptune's center, the Le Verrier Ring, 53,000 km, and the 
                wider, faintly outlined Galle Ring, 42,000 km.. The Le Verrier Ring also has an extension called Lassell. 
                This connects to the outer end of the Arago ring at about 57000 km. The first planetary ring was discovered 
                in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan, but it was later thought to be incomplete. Evidence that the rings 
                may have gaps first appeared during a stellar occultation in 1984, when the ring covered a star in immersion 
                but not in emergence. Images taken by Voyager 2 in 1989 showed the existence of several thin rings with a 
                massive structure, the cause of this structure is still not understood, but there are theories stating that 
                the phenomenon could be due to the gravitational interaction of the satellites small orbiting nearby. The 
                outermost ring, Adams, contains five arcs called Courage, Liberté, Egalité 1, Egalité 2, and Fraternité 
                (Courage, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity). Their existence has been difficult to explain because the laws 
                of motion predict that arcs should spread out in a uniform ring over short periods of time. Astronomers believe 
                that the arcs are maintained in their current shape due to the gravitational effects created by the satellite 
                Galatea, a satellite inside the ring. Earth-based observations of Neptune in 2005 revealed that the rings are 
                much more unstable. Images taken at the WM Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay of the 
                rings compared to images taken by Voyager 2. In particular it looks like the Liberté arch could disappear in 
                less than a century.

            <h1>Climate</h1>
            <p>
                One of the differences between Uranus and Neptune is also the weather activity. When the Voyager 2 spacecraft 
                flew past the planet Uranus in 1986, it was visually quite calm. In contrast, Neptune exhibited notable meteorological 
                phenomena during its 1989 flyby by Voyager 2. The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud), and the 
                Little Dark Spot (bottom), with exaggerated contrast. Neptune's weather is characterized by highly dynamic storm 
                systems, with winds reaching speeds of nearly 600 m/s — near supersonic flow. Following the movements of persistent 
                clouds, it has been shown that the wind speed varies from 20 m/s when the wind is eastward, to 325 m/s when it is 
                moving west. At the top of the clouds, wind speeds vary between 400 m/s along the equator and 250 m/s at the poles. 
                Most of Neptune's winds move in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation. The overall wind pattern showed a 
                prograde rotation at high latitudes versus a retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction 
                is considered to be a "surface effect", which is not due to any other deep atmospheric process. At 70° south latitude, 
                a high speed jet moves at a speed of 300 m/s. The abundance of methane, ethane, and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 
                10-100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for the existence of updrafts at the equator and 
                downdrafts near the poles. In 2007, Neptune's upper troposphere at the south pole was found to be 10 °C warmer than the 
                rest of the planet, where the average temperature is -200 °C (70 K). The temperature difference at this pole is sufficient 
                to allow methane, which is frozen in other parts of Neptune's upper atmosphere, to escape as a gas into space. This relative 
                "hot spot" is due to the tilt of Neptune's rotation axis, which has exposed the south pole to the Sunover the last quarter of 
                the Neptune year, or about 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves to the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole darkens 
                while the north pole brightens, causing the release of methane to shift to the north pole. Due to seasonal changes, 
                it has been observed that in the southern hemisphere of the planet cloud bands increase in size and albedo. This 
                trend was first noted in 1980 and is expected to last until about 2020. The result of Neptune's long orbital period 
                is that the seasons are about forty years long.
