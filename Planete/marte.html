            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the penultimate largest planet in the Solar System. Mars is 
                named after the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the Red Planet, because the predominant 
                iron oxide on its surface gives it a distinctive reddish appearance among astronomical bodies visible 
                to the naked eye. Mars is a telluric planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent 
                of both the impact craters of the Moon and Earth-like valleys, deserts and polar ice caps. The days and 
                seasons are comparable to Earth's because the rotation period as well as the axial tilt relative to the 
                ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is home to Mount Olympus, the largest volcano and most famous mountain 
                of any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. 
                The Northern Hemisphere basin covers 40% of the planet and can be a sign of huge impact. Mars has two moons, 
                Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. They may be asteroidscaptured, similar to 5261 
                Eureka, a Mars Trojan. Mars has been explored by numerous unmanned spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by 
                NASA on November 28, 1964, was the first spacecraft to visit Mars, with the closest approach to the 
                planet occurring on July 15, 1965. Mariner 4 detected the faint Martian radiation belt, measured at 
                about 0.1 % of that of Earth and captured the first images of another planet from deep space. 
                On July 20, 1976, Viking 1 made the first successful landing on the Martian surface. Although the Soviet
                spacecraft Mars 3had a soft start in Dec 1971, lost contact after a few seconds. [26] On July 4, 1997, 
                the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars, and on July 5, the mission's rover, Sojourner , became the first 
                robotic rover to operate on Mars. Pathfinder was followed by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed 
                in January 2004 and operated until March 22, 2010 and June 10, 2018, respectively. The Mars Express Orbiter, 
                the first European Space Agency spacecraft to reached orbit on 25 December 2003. NASA landed the Curiosity rover 
                on August 6, 2012, as part of its Mars Science Laboratory mission to investigate Martian climate and geology. 
                On 24 September 2014, the Indian Space Research Organization became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when 
                its interplanetary Mars Orbiter Mission successfully entered orbit. The United Arab Emirates became the fifth 
                country to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, inserting an orbiter into the Martian atmosphere on 9 
                February 2021 and China the sixth country when the Tianwen mission -1 entered the planet's orbit on February 10,
                 2021. NASA's Perseverance rover successfully landed on Mars on February 18, 2021.

            <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
            <p>
                Mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago, probably due to numerous asteroid impacts, so the 
                solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, decreasing the atmospheric density by 
                removing atoms from the outer layer. Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected ionized 
                atmospheric particles escaping into space in the wake of Mars, and this atmospheric loss is being 
                studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, Mars' atmosphere is very thin. Atmospheric pressure 
                varies from a low of 30 Pa on Mount Olympus to over 1,155 Pa in Hellas Planitia, with an average 
                surface-level pressure of 600 Pa.  On Earth, such pressure is found at an altitude of 35 km above 
                sea level. The average surface pressure is only 0.6% of Earth's. The pressure in the Martian atmosphere 
                decreases with altitude more slowly than on Earth, the relative decrease occurring approximately every 10.8 km 
                (on Earth approximately every 6 km). This is due to the much lower gravitational acceleration on the surface of 
                Mars (about 38% of that of Earth). The atmosphere on Mars consists of approximately 96% carbon dioxide, 
                1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water. The atmosphere is quite thin, 
                containing particles about 1.5 Âµm in diameter, which give the Martian sky an opaque color when seen 
                from the surface. It can take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in the atmosphere.

            <h1>Orbit and rotation</h1>
            <p>
                The average distance of Mars from the Sun is about 230 million km, and the orbital period (Martian year) 
                lasts as long as 687 days on Earth. A day on Mars (called sol) is only slightly longer than a day on Earth: 
                24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years or 1 year, 320 days 
                and 18.2 hours. The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to 
                the axial tilt of the Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, although they are almost twice as 
                long on Mars because its orbital period is much longer. In its current orientation, the north pole of Mars 
                points in a direction similar to the location of the star Deneb. Mars has a relatively pronounced orbital 
                eccentricity of about 0.09; among the planets of the Solar System only Mercury has a greater orbital eccentricity. 
                Mars is known to have had a much more circular orbit in the past. At one point, 1.35 million years ago (Earth years), 
                Mars had an eccentricity of about 0.002, much less than Earth's today. Mars' eccentricity cycle is 96,000 Earth years, 
                compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer eccentricity cycle with a period of 2.2 million Earth 
                years, and this overlaps the 96,000 year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. Over the past 35,000 years, Mars' orbit 
                has become somewhat more eccentric due to the gravitational effects of the other planets. The closest distance 
                between Earth and Mars will continue to decrease slightly for the next 25,000 years.
